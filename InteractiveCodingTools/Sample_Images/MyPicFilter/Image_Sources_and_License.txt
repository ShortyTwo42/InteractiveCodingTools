The images used are either in the public domain or are Wikimedia Commons-hosted images of two-dimensional public domain artwork. For Germany the following terms of use apply:

"German law distinguishes between photographic works (1) and simple photographs (2), which, in principle, are protected under a neighbouring right; however, simple photographs of "works of visual art" in the public domain are not protected. Simple scans or photocopies are never protected (3). Wikimedia Commons-hosted images of two-dimensional public domain artwork usually fall into the second category. Therefore, the reuse of such material is typically unproblematic.

(1) Photographic works: While definitive guidance from the courts is lacking, it is widely assumed by legal scholars and practitioners alike that the faithful photographic reproduction of a "flat" object generally does not attract protection as a photographic work. In the same vein, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals noted in a 2017 decision that the panel could not find "any substantial use of artistic creativity" in a professional museum photographer's pictures of paintings (although the Court ultimately did not decide the question).

(2) Simple photographs: In general, German copyright law also protects simple photographs that do not rise to the leval of a photographic work due to their lack of originality. However, following a EU Directive, the German Copyright Act was amended, effective 7 June 2021, in an effort to exclude certain photographs of public domain material from protection as simple photographs. The current legal situation is thus as follows:

Simple photographs of works of visual art in the public domain are not protected. Neither the German Copyright Act nor the EU Directive that prompted the new provision give a definition of the term "works of visual art". In the official reasoning provided with the (at the time: proposed) amendment, the German government notes that it understands the term to match a similar term used in another EU Directive, where "visual works" are explained as including "fine art, photography, illustration, design, architecture, sketches of the latter works and other such works that are contained in books, journals, newspapers and magazines or other works". Materials that are not "works of visual art" may include manuscripts and music sheets. Because the provision refers to works of visual art, it only applies to pictures of material that is an author's own intellectual creation, ie material that, in the abstract, could be eligible for copyright protection, as opposed to, say, paintings created by an elephant. Notably, the exception does not specifically require that the depicted work must have enjoyed protection at any time; accordingly, the Government points out that simple photographs of paintings from the 16th century are also unprotected. Also according to the official reasoning, the exclusion from protection applies to simple photographic reproductions irrespective of whether they were created before or after 7 July 2021. It does not apply to reproductions that constitute photographic works.

Simple photographs that are not exempt from protection as per the preceding paragraph enjoy protection until 50 years after their first publication; if a simple photograph is not published within 50 years following its creation, its protection ends at that point.

(3) Unprotected photographs: Purely mechanical reproductions are not protected. Examples given in the literature are images resulting from the use of a photocopying machine or a document scanner."
